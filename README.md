Geo-location SQL

MySQL DDL to store Geo-Locations and report on them. Use insert_location() or insert_current_location() to add data and the caches will be maintained correctly. Use distance caching to rapidly determine speeds and distances. Use approximated location caching to rapidly determine popular locations. Named after Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz after the theory that frequency of geo-spatial data could find her home, this code does that. Feel free to contribute. Stalkers and paedophiles, just don't.
